### TumorScope - Revolutionizing Cancer Diagnosis with AI üí°

TumorScope is an innovative web application designed to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of cancer using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. Our mission is to provide a platform that enables doctors and patients to collaborate effectively, ensuring accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment plans.

üìñ Description
---------------
TumorScope is a comprehensive platform that integrates multiple features to support cancer diagnosis and treatment. The application includes a user-friendly interface for patients to upload their medical records and images, which are then analyzed by our AI-powered algorithms to detect potential tumors. The system also provides a secure portal for doctors to access patient records, review diagnostic reports, and develop personalized treatment plans.

The TumorScope platform is built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. The application utilizes the Flask framework to handle requests and responses, while the AI-powered algorithms are implemented using the Keras library. The platform also incorporates a database to store patient records and diagnostic reports, ensuring secure and efficient data management.

The development of TumorScope is driven by the need for accurate and efficient cancer diagnosis. Traditional diagnosis methods can be time-consuming and prone to errors, which can have devastating consequences for patients. TumorScope aims to address these challenges by providing a platform that leverages the power of AI and machine learning to improve diagnosis accuracy and treatment outcomes.
